## 🌍 1. Overview: What is Happening?

In disasters such as earthquakes, building collapses, floods, and severe grid failures, traditional communications collapse in two catastrophic ways:
1. **Infrastructure Blackout**: Cell towers lose power, fiber backbones sever, and internet access disappears.
2. **Victim Silence**: Trapped, pinned, or unconscious victims cannot press SOS buttons, unlock phones, or speak.

### What MeshGrid Does
MeshGrid transforms standard smartphones, tablets, and laptops into a **self-healing, zero-install, decentralized rescue mesh**.
- Devices discover each other locally and form **serverless WebRTC data channels**.
- Messages, voice notes, photos, and GPS coordinates route **hop-by-hop** across devices without requiring internet or cellular service.
- If the signaling server dies after initial handshake, the **P2P mesh continues operating independently**.
- When victims cannot move, **PulseSeeker** passively monitors ambient audio (rhythmic debris tapping) and motion sensors (unconscious stillness) to auto-dispatch emergency survivor beacons.
- When GPS is blocked by concrete rubble, **EchoLocate** calculates indoor 2D positions using ultrasonic acoustic chirps and multilateration.
- The **Lifeboat Engine** scores multi-sensor lethality (0–100) and routes critical cases to the front of rescue queues.

```

### 1. Serverless P2P Discovery & Routing
1. When a device joins, it connects to `signaling-server.js` (port 4001) for 1–2 seconds to exchange WebRTC SDP offers/answers with 1–2 nearby peers.
2. Once data channels are open, peers exchange **Link-State Gossip Packets**.
3. Each node independently builds an adjacency matrix of the network and computes shortest paths via **Dijkstra's Algorithm**.
4. If a relay node disconnects or the signaling server is killed, surviving nodes recalculate alternate routes instantly without dropping connectivity.

### 2. End-to-End Encryption Pipeline
1. On startup, each node generates an ephemeral ECDH keypair and ECDSA signing keypair using `crypto.subtle`.
2. Public keys are broadcasted across the gossip protocol.
3. When Node A messages Node B:
   - Node A derives a shared AES-256-GCM key: `deriveSharedKey(Priv_A, Pub_B)`.
   - Node A encrypts the payload (text, media, location) with an initialization vector (IV).
   - Node A signs the ciphertext envelope using `Sign_A`.
4. Intermediate relay nodes inspect only the routing envelope (`to`, `from`, `hopIndex`) and forward ciphertext without reading it.
5. Node B verifies the signature with `SignPub_A` and decrypts with `deriveSharedKey(Priv_B, Pub_A)`.

### 3. Media Chunking & Voice Transmission
1. When capturing voice notes, `MediaRecorder` buffers audio into Opus/AAC/MP4 data chunks.
2. On stop, the audio blob is converted to a base64 DataURL and split into 12,000-character transmission chunks.
3. Chunks stream across WebRTC data channels with sequence numbers (`chunkIndex / totalChunks`).
4. The destination reassembles and verifies the chunks, rendering an inline audio player with one-tap playback.

### 4. EchoLocate Acoustic Positioning
1. Because browser clocks are unsynchronized, EchoLocate implements **Time-Division Acoustic Round-Trip Time (RTT)**.
2. Pinger Device emits an ultrasonic 17–19 kHz Linear Frequency Modulated (LFM) chirp.
3. Listener devices detect the chirp using **Matched-Filter Cross-Correlation** and reply at scheduled time offsets.
4. The Pinger calculates pairwise distances: $d = \frac{\Delta T_{\text{RTT}} - \text{offset}}{2} \times 343\text{ m/s}$.
5. A 2D least-squares multilateration algorithm converts distances into relative $(x, y)$ coordinates and plots them on the radar canvas.

### 5. PulseSeeker Passive Survivor Detection
1. Runs background feature extraction: 13 MFCC sub-bands, Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR), Spectral Centroids, and accelerometer variance.
2. A 2-layer in-browser neural matrix evaluates signals against:
   - **Rhythmic Pipe/Wall Tapping**: 2–4 Hz peak periodicity with high high-frequency harmonics.
   - **Inertial Unconsciousness**: Accelerometer variance $< 0.02\text{ m/s}^2$ for $> 5\text{ minutes}$.
3. When detection confidence exceeds 80%, PulseSeeker automatically constructs an SOS beacon and broadcasts it across the mesh.

### 6. Lifeboat Lethality Scoring & Rescuer Queue
1. Ingests multi-sensor telemetry at `POST /api/heartbeat`.
2. Computes lethality score (0–100):
   - Sudden Barometer Drop ($>5\text{ hPa/min}$): **+50 pts**
   - Ambient Darkness ($<5\text{ lux}$): **+30 pts**
   - Injury Keywords (*bleeding, trapped, crushed*): **+25 pts**
   - Flood Keywords (*water rising, drowning*): **+20 pts**
   - Vulnerable Person (*infant, pregnant, elderly*): **+15 pts**
   - Water Proximity / Low Battery: **+10–15 pts**
3. Enqueues critical survivors ($\ge 80\text{ pts}$) at the top of the priority queue for instant rescuer deployment.

## 💡 8. Limitations & Production Roadmap

- **Acoustic Attenuation**: High-frequency acoustic chirps (17–19 kHz) attenuate through thick concrete walls. EchoLocate exposes configurable frequency ranges (e.g. 15–18 kHz) for real-device hardware tuning.
- **Mobile HTTPS Sandbox**: Mobile browsers require HTTPS for microphone and motion sensors. MeshGrid includes built-in SSL support (`@vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl`) for seamless local Wi-Fi testing.
- **Time-Division Interval**: Acoustic positioning uses discrete 15-second time-division rounds to avoid clock sync issues without requiring GPS time servers.
- **PKI Fingerprint Roadmap**: Session keypairs are generated per browser session. Production deployments can pre-provision device fingerprints via QR-code pairing prior to field operations.
